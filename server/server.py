Every test comes back perfectly, they say on paper I am the healthiest person they have ever seen, and I look that way on the outside as well being a lifelong athlete, but...  Since I was 11 I have gotten my period twice a month (extremely heavy, terrible pain and symptoms, both periods lasting 7-9 days), my longest period was 26 days long.  At 14 I randomly become ""reactive"" to meat and sensitive to dairy, I have seen an allergist and nothing comes up, but if I eat meat (red or white - I have been tested for texas lone star tick) I need to go to the hospital (days of throwing up, fainting, stomach issues). I have been on a vegan diet because of this, but I eat extremely healthy and clean. I track my iron intake and protein, and generally eat very clean (saw a dietitian for a while, bloodwork also comes back great every time).  I drink 5+ gallons of water a day - yes, really that much, I track it - if I do not drink this much, I get overheated, dry mouth, and feel faint (thyroid has been tested).  When I became ""reactive"" to meat, I would break out in red hives if I ate it, now I avoid it at all costs (rash completely went away), but I still have a white rash that comes up. I am told it is remnants of an old rash/scarring, but the white spots appear and disappear seemingly randomly.  I have times where I will be extremely motivated and going to the gym every day for months, then there will be months where I can't get out of bed even for work, its more lethargy than depression, but naturally lying in bed for months will make you depressed.  I have had mental problems since I was a young kid (starting before elementary school), but my periods seem to bring on psychotic/schizophrenic tendencies - I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, bipolar 1 and 2, schizoaffective disorder etc. At its worst, I had brain scans done but everything looked good.  Honestly I'm tired of hearing that it is a mental thing when I have so many other issues that are going on physically and my mental issues are treatment resistant (I have probably been on every mental-related medication you can name, not currently on any). I can't help but feel like I was born broken and I'll have to live like this forever lol.  Hoping someone can at least point me in a new direction/give me some ideas of tests to request!"))
